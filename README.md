# tiian.org

tiian.org is my personal open and free software initiative; it hosts 3 projects:

- LIXA, LIbre XA
- FLoM, Free Lock Manager
- LIBJF, LIBrary for Journaled Files

LIXA is the largest project and still in evolution, FLoM can be considered a stable project and LIBJF is a quite old project that I have not touched since many years.
