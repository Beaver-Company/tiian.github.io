# tiian.org

tiian.org is my personal open and free software initiative; it hosts 3 projects:

- [LIXA](https://github.com/tiian/lixa/manuals/html/index.html), LIbre XA
- [FLoM](https://github.com/tiian/flom), Free Lock Manager
- [LIBJF](http://libjf.sourceforge.net), LIBrary for Journaled Files

LIXA is the largest project and still in evolution, FLoM can be considered a stable project and LIBJF is a quite old project that I have not touched since many years.
