# LIXA - LIbre XA

LIXA is a free and open source implementation of XA and TX specifications.
Since version 1.5 it ships XTA, **XA Transaction API**, a new transactional API for applications.

Here is the last version of the LIXA manual as an HTML document:

- [multiple pages](/manuals/html/index.html)
- [single page](/manuals/html/index_all_in_one.html)

Main hosting site is [GitHub](https://github.com/tiian/lixa), alternative hosting site is [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lixa/).

Legacy [home page](https://sourceforge.net/p/lixa/wiki/) still contains interesting contents that will be gradually migrated to this new site.
